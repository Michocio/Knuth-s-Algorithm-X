# Knuth-s-Algorithm-X
Exact cover solution

**Algorithm X** is the name **Donald Knuth** used in his paper "Dancing Links" to refer to "the most obvious trial-and-error approach" for finding all solutions to the exact cover problem.[1] Technically, Algorithm X is a recursive, nondeterministic, depth-first, backtracking algorithm. While Algorithm X is generally useful as a succinct explanation of how the exact cover problem may be solved, Knuth's intent in presenting it 
was merely to demonstrate the utility of the dancing links technique via an efficient implementation he called DLX.

Applications:
* sudoku solver
* Pentomino tiling
* N queens problem
* so much more...


**Project is great example of pointers in c. It uses pointers in many ways**
